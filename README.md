# LLM Performance Optimization

A comprehensive framework for evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) runtime performance and investigating optimization strategies for specific hardware platforms.

## Overview

This project aims to provide tools and methodologies for:
- Benchmarking LLM inference performance across different hardware configurations
- Identifying performance bottlenecks in LLM execution
- Developing and validating hardware-specific optimization techniques
- Providing actionable insights for deploying LLMs efficiently

## Objectives

1. **Performance Evaluation**: Establish comprehensive benchmarking suite for LLM runtime metrics
2. **Hardware Analysis**: Characterize performance across diverse hardware platforms (GPUs, CPUs, NPUs, custom accelerators)
3. **Optimization Research**: Investigate and validate optimization techniques including:
   - Model quantization (INT8, INT4, FP16, etc.)
   - Kernel optimization
   - Memory management strategies
   - Batching and scheduling algorithms
   - Hardware-specific optimizations
4. **Best Practices**: Document hardware-specific optimization guidelines and deployment recommendations

## Scope

### Hardware Platforms
- NVIDIA GPUs (various architectures)
- AMD GPUs
- Intel CPUs and GPUs
- ARM processors
- Custom AI accelerators (TPUs, AWS Inferentia, etc.)
- Mobile and edge devices

### LLM Categories
- Decoder-only models (GPT-style)
- Encoder-decoder models (T5-style)
- Various model sizes (from small edge models to large server models)

### Performance Metrics

## Getting Started

*Coming soon - detailed setup and usage instructions will be added*

## Profiling Requirements (Nsight Systems)

To capture end‑to‑end GPU/CPU timelines while running DeepSeek‑OCR and other workloads, we use NVIDIA Nsight Systems (`nsys`). Please install it so profiling commands work locally.

Preferred install order (where applicable): uv (PyPI) > pixi/conda‑forge > apt > direct .deb

- Nsight Systems (nsys)
  - Ubuntu (recommended):
    - `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y nsight-systems nsight-systems-target`
  - Or download from NVIDIA Developer if apt isn’t available: https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-systems
  - Verify: `nsys --version`

- Optional: Nsight Compute (ncu) for per‑kernel analysis
  - pixi/conda‑forge: `pixi add nsight-compute -c conda-forge`
  - Verify: `ncu --version`

- Optional: NVTX annotations for readable timelines
  - `uv pip install -U nvtx`

Example capture:

```
nsys profile --trace=cuda,nvtx,osrt -o tmp/nsys/deepseek \
  pixi run python tests/manual/deepseek_ocr_hf_manual.py
```
