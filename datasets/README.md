Datasets Directory

Organizes datasets with a `source-data` symlink and optional variant subfolders
(e.g., `subset-1k/`, `tokenized-gpt2/`). Include per-dataset `metadata.yaml`
and `README.md` to document provenance and transformations.

Large data should live outside the repo and be linked via symlinks.
