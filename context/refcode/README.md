# Refcode Directory

## HEADER
- **Purpose**: Store external source code for REFERENCE-ONLY - serves as documentation
- **Status**: Active
- **Date**: 2025-11-17
- **Dependencies**: context/README.md
- **Target**: AI assistants and developers

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: REFERENCE-ONLY CODE

**DO NOT USE OR MODIFY CODE IN THIS DIRECTORY**

This directory contains external source code that serves **exclusively as documentation and reference material**. The code here is:

- **READ-ONLY**: For understanding patterns, APIs, and implementation approaches
- **NOT FOR EXECUTION**: Do not import, run, or integrate this code into the project
- **NOT FOR MODIFICATION**: Do not edit, refactor, or update these files
- **DOCUMENTATION EQUIVALENT**: Treat as you would API docs or technical specifications

### Proper Usage
✅ **DO**: Read to understand library internals, design patterns, or API usage  
✅ **DO**: Reference when designing similar functionality  
✅ **DO**: Use as a learning resource for implementation approaches  

❌ **DON'T**: Import or execute this code in project modules  
❌ **DON'T**: Modify or refactor these reference files  
❌ **DON'T**: Copy-paste without proper attribution and license compliance  
❌ **DON'T**: Treat as part of the project codebase  

## Content
This directory contains vetted external source code from third-party libraries, frameworks, and reference implementations. These files provide insight into:
- Internal implementation details of dependencies
- Design patterns used by established projects
- API usage examples directly from source
- Integration approaches and best practices

## Conventions
- Organize by library/project name (e.g., `thicket/`, `torchlens/`, `huggingface/`)
- Preserve original file structure when helpful for context
- Include source attribution (repository URL, commit hash, license) in a metadata file
- Each substantial example should include documentation explaining why it's referenced
