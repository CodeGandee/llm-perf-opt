# Troubleshooting

No outputs created
- Ensure dataset root exists: `conf/dataset/omnidocbench.yaml` â†’ `datasets/omnidocbench/source-data`
- Run with Pixi (not system Python): `pixi run bench-stage1`

Boxes misaligned in visualization
- Verify that predictions are saved with specials intact (`outputs.save_predictions=true`).
- Compare our `viz/<stem>/result_with_boxes.jpg` with vendor output from `scripts/deepseek-ocr-infer-one.py`.

Flash-Attn warnings
- Model is moved to GPU; dtype defaults to bf16. Warnings are benign for inference; set `use_flash_attn=false` to compare.

Hydra override errors
- When selecting grouped configs, include targets: `model/deepseek_ocr/arch@model=...` and `model/deepseek_ocr/infer@infer=...`.

Where are logs?
- Each run writes `llm_profile_runner.log` under `tmp/stage1/<run_id>/`.
