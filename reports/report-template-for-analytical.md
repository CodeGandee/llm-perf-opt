# Analytical Analysis of DNN Model

This report provides an analytical analysis of the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model, including:
- Theoretical FLOPs and memory usage for key layers and the overall model
- Arithmetic Intensity calculations for key layers and the overall model
- How those metrics vary with input size and model configuration
- Insights into potential performance bottlenecks based on the analytical metrics
