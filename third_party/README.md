Third-Party Reference Sources

Read-only upstream sources used for reference (e.g., Transformers, vLLM).

Management options:
- Symlinks to existing local checkouts (fastest, not portable)
- Git submodules (pin exact commits, good reproducibility)
- Git subtree (behaves like normal folder)
- Sparse-checkout (only parts of large repos)
- Hub snapshots (code-only, no Git history)

Treat contents as read-only. Do not modify without explicit review.
