# Dataset config: OmniDocBench

name: OmniDocBench
root: ${hydra:runtime.cwd}/datasets/omnidocbench/source-data

# Provide a subset as a newline-delimited file list (path relative to `root`, or absolute)
# Example (relative to `root`): subsets/dev-20.txt
subset_filelist: null

# Fallback glob patterns used only when subset_filelist is null
# Each entry is a glob pattern relative to `root`. The combined matches form the
# intended file list. De-duplication is left to the user (or caller) to handle.
fallback_patterns:
  - "images/*.png"
  - "images/*.jpg"
