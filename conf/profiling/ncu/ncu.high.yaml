# Nsight Compute preset (High Coverage)
# Includes everything from ncu.default plus the union of sections used by
# the RTX 3090 presets (balanced/compute/memory). Use when you want broader
# section coverage in a single run.

description: High‑coverage Nsight Compute preset (default metrics + union of GA102 sections)

ncu_cli:
  # Profile all child processes by default (matches `--target-processes all`).
  target_processes: all
  # Default replay mode (kernel-level). Override as needed for NVTX aggregation.
  replay_mode: kernel

  # Optional NVTX gating
  # By default, NVTX gating is defined but disabled (include: null).
  # Override `ncu_cli.nvtx.include` at runtime, e.g., '+pipeline.ncu.ncu_cli.nvtx.include=decode*'
  nvtx:
    include: null   # When set, passes --nvtx --nvtx-include <expr>

  # Section preset
  set: roofline           # Built-in NCU preset for roofline/SpeedOfLight analyses

  # Kernel name matching base for regex (maps to --kernel-name-base)
  kernel_name_base: demangled

  # Metrics to collect (concise, device-portable set)
  metrics:
    - flop_count_hp       # Half-precision floating-point operation count
    - flop_count_sp       # Single-precision floating-point operation count
    - gpu__time_duration.sum  # Total kernel duration on GPU timeline
    - sm__throughput.avg.pct_of_peak_sustained_elapsed   # SM throughput (% of peak sustained)
    - dram__throughput.avg.pct_of_peak_sustained_elapsed # DRAM throughput (% of peak sustained)

  # Sections to include in the report (union of RTX 3090 presets)
  sections:
    - SpeedOfLight            # High-level utilization vs peak for compute/memory
    - ComputeWorkloadAnalysis # Compute pipeline utilization (Tensor, FP, INT)
    - MemoryWorkloadAnalysis  # Memory hierarchy behavior and bandwidth analysis
    - WorkloadDistribution    # Workload distribution by memory/cache levels
    - Occupancy               # Achieved vs theoretical occupancy and limiting factors
    - SchedulerStats          # Warp issue eligibility/scheduling statistics
    - WarpStateStats          # Stall reasons by warp state
    - LaunchStats             # Grid/block dimensions and resource usage
    - InstructionStats        # Instruction mix and counts

  # Advanced NCU CLI controls (script-managed per-kernel; shown for reference)
  # Kernel name filtering (maps to --kernel-name or -k):
  #   - Exact match (default): kernel_name: my_exact_kernel_name
  #   - Regex match: kernel_name: regex:my_pattern
  #   Since NCU 2021.1+, exact match is default; use "regex:" prefix for pattern matching.
  # kernel_name: my_kernel        # => --kernel-name my_kernel (exact match)
  # kernel_name: regex:my_.*      # => --kernel-name regex:my_.* (regex match)
  # launch_skip: 200              # => --launch-skip <N> (script default 200)
  # launch_count: 1               # => --launch-count <M> (script default 1)

  # Export preferences for downstream tooling (CSV-friendly outputs)
  export:
    csv: true

  # Enable safe overwrite of existing outputs (maps to --force-overwrite)
  force_overwrite: true
