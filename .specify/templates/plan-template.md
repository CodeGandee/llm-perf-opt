# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Pythonic clarity & docstrings: All new/changed public APIs/classes include
  NumPy‑style docstrings and illustrative examples.
- Typed, linted, formatted: All new code is fully type‑annotated; `mypy` passes
  with zero errors; `ruff` lint/format passes with zero errors.
- OO discipline for functional classes: Member vars prefixed with `m_`; use
  properties for read‑only access and `set_xxx()` for mutations; constructors
  argument‑free with `from_xxx()` factories where needed.
- Data models: Use `attrs` (default) with `@define(kw_only=True)` and `field`
  metadata, or `pydantic` for web schemas; no business logic in models.
- Runtime environment declared: Execution context specified (Pixi preferred;
  otherwise venv). Commands in this plan use that environment explicitly.
- Testing plan: Manual tests provided for major functionality with file paths
  under `tests/manual/…`. Automated tests only if requested or critical; specify
  locations under `tests/unit/…` and `tests/integration/…` if included.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
